            # WoC 3.0: Mid-Evaluation:
Project: Android Chat Application
Topics Covered: Everything upto checkpoint 3 + “Intents” from checkpoint 4 (Although
not compulsory but you can use other concepts of checkpoint 4 if you want but not
beyond that)

Date: January 16

Deadline: January 17 (7 AM)

## Task:
1. You are supposed to make an Android application that contains your timetable
for Winter Semester 2021.(Needles to say,we mentors won’t be entertaining your
doubts during the mid-evaluation phase but use of Google and StackOverflow is
allowed)
2. Main Activity should have six buttons stacked vertically, each corresponding to a
day from Mon-Sat. Clicking on each of them should take you to another activity
that contains lectures and labs scheduled on that day. ( so in total there should
be at least 6 + 1(MainActivity) = 7 Activities.)
3. Focus first on logic and then once you’re done with functionality stated in step-2,
focus on the design part in order to make your app as attractive as possible.
4. All these steps should preferably have corresponding git commits which shall
make it easier for us to track your progress. Your final app should be uploaded
on github with repository name woc3.0-android-mid-evaluation-<your_name> in
branch “woc” (commits to main or master branch won’t be considered for
evaluation meaning if you want to commit after the deadline passes for the sake
of completing your app, you should do that in some other branch except “woc”.
You will be straight-away disqualified if we find that you’ve made any commit in
“woc” branch after the deadline)
5. Submit the link to your repository here: https://forms.gle/Bog3RBgueDo6ifX5A
6. (optional) share the APK file of this app with your batchmates and spread the joy
of learning and Developing apps !
